## Lyrics

```

this game's - truly never really counts to self
when the bodies fall fewer doubts're playin off 
of the cup - please-fame for people way too dull so  --- get it now
do it for yourself not other people's shady rules

truce for the single-minded brother hauls
don't you know i open doors so often for the blinded ones
scared you'll be careless till you see the what is what
and yet the secrets can make you rush like a fool

too fast too fast makes you trip
slow down slow down your only drip
make up make up stories for the sick
it's their dreams you want, get them rich
i never gonna
