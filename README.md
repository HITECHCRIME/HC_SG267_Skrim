## Lyrics

```

this game's - truly never really counts to self
when the bodies fall fewer doubts're playin off 
get it now, please-fame is for people way too dull so 
do it for yourself not other people's rules

truce for the single-minded brother hauls
don't you know i open doors for the blinded ones
careless till you see the what is what and yet still
even then the secrets can make you rush

too fast too fast makes you trip
slow down slow down your only drip
make up make up stories for the sick
it's their dreams you want, get them rich

```
